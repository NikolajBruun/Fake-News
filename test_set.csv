The focus of this new examination, according to the Daily Beast:

How much classified information passed through Clinton's private server?

Who transferred that information into an unclassified area, and how?

Which investigators knew about the issues and when?

What, if any, immunity agreements Clinton aides struck?

The decision to reopen scrutiny into Clinton's emails comes in the aftermath of President Donald Trump accusing his own law enforcement agency of being part of the deep state for not investigating reported mishandling of classified info by former top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018

Trump, of course, has constantly beaten the drum for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reopen an investigation into Clinton.

Many people in our Country are asking what the “Justice” Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and “acid washed” 33,000 Emails? No justice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2017

""People should be encouraged that the new leadership at the Justice Department is actually interested in a nonpartisan, above-board Justice Department that treats every citizen equally,"" Mark Corallo, former DOJ spokesman in the George W. Bush administration, told the Daily Beast.

""It's about time they're doing a review of this whole mess,"" Corallo said.

And the predictable retort from Clinton's side.

""The Justice Department should not be opening itself up to the perception that it is bending to political pressures from the White House,"" former Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon told the Daily Beast.

""The Justice Department is supposed to operate independently of the White House, and even if this is just a perfunctory step that they're taking to try to appease the president, that in and of itself is an abuse of the DOJ authority,"" Fallon said.",2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Daily Beast: DOJ Is Taking a Fresh Look Into Hillary's Emails,Mark Swanson,,"['department of justice', 'daily beast', 'investigation', 'hillary clinton emails']","The Department of Justice has decided to review again Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and her handling of classified information while secretary of state, the Daily Beast is reporting.","Trump Administration, ISIS/Islamic State, Gun Rights, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Russia",

Well, enough of that.

You see, as much as we may hope for new beginnings… new beginnings have to be built upon old realities. And here’s a statistic that we have to build upon; last year, police have killed 1,147 people according to mappingpoliceviolence.org – a group which obtained its data from Fatal Encounters, the U.S. Police Shootings Database and Killed By Police.

The shocking part (ok not really)? Only in 1%, or 13 of these cases was an officer charged with any crime. Let that fact sink in as you realize that historically, only a third of these cases result in a conviction.

A majority of these cases begin when police suspected individuals of non-violent offenses, or no crime had been reported.

149 of those killed were completely unarmed, while 112 had a vehicle as a weapon, 170 a knife, 617 a gun and 99 had “other” or unidentified weapons.

In the 170 cases where the suspect had a knife, only in 31% of the cases was less lethal force attempted before shooting them. Police in the UK were faced with a similarly high rate of people armed with knives yet had to resort to guns in only 4 cases.

“Consistent with international law, police in the UK are prohibited from using firearms except where strictly necessary after considering non-violent and less lethal options.”

This sort of shoot-first-ask-questions-later mentality probably has something to do with the low 0.33% conviction rate mentioned earlier… and the fact that only 4 states have laws that mandate that police have to attempt other means of incapacitating a suspect (when reasonable) before using deadly force… and the fact that police spend 7 times as many hours training to fire a weapon as opposed to learning to de-escalate a situation or use a baton. In fact, Police spend more time training to shoot than… any other single item on their training schedule.

Of the cases where a person was armed with a firearm, 1 out of 5 were not threatening anyone. Only in 43% of all cases was the person posing a threat with a gun; theoretically, a majority of these cases could have been resolved without the use of deadly force.

With the number of officers killed at the lowest in 50 years, at 44 shot (more, 47 to be exact, were killed in vehicle crashes), it would not seem that they are under any increased threat to their own personal safety…",2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,"In 2017, Police Killed 1,184 — 100 Times The Number Of Americans Killed By Terrorists",Please Enter Your Name Here,,[''],"149 of those killed were completely unarmed, while 112 had a vehicle as a weapon, 170 a knife, 617 a gun and 99 had ""other"" or unidentified weapons.",,

Kevin, Andrew, and Luis Palau all stood together on Thursday to make the shocking announcement that beloved world-renowned evangelist Luis Palau was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer.

""We wanted to tape this video to tell the whole world that love dad and the work that we do what's been going on in dad's life,"" Kevin, president of Luis Palau Ministries, said in the social media video posted Thursday.

He then proceeded to share that his father fell ill after a busy fall season, as he returned from an overseas trip to the U.K. They believed he only had a chest cold but when it didn't go away the family convinced Luis to go to the doctor.

""To our surprise, the early report that we got just before Christmas [said] that there was some cancer inside one of dad's lungs,"" Kevin explained.

They got extra testing done and went to an oncologist who revealed the terminal diagnosis.

""Just a few days ago we got the word that it's stage 4 lung cancer. That's a shock, especially with someone who's always been as healthy as dad,"" he continued.

The son said they made the video so that people can join them in prayer. Luis then shared his heart concerning everything.

""I haven't been in a hospital one night except for when I broke a bone back in 1984 after missions from London,"" the esteemed Argentinian evangelist shared.

""To me, the first thing you do is cry. I think 'oh wow, I can be gone in a few months' and one silly thought that came to mind is that I won't be able to pick up the phone and talk to the boys and hear their voice and talk to my wife,"" Luis emotionally shared.

""This is sad, I don't feel panic or horror, if [I'm] healed, hallelujah! And many people are praying that the Lord will do a miracle. It would take literally a miracle medically speaking. Stage 4 is big time.""

He went on to say that the peace he felt immediately was that at least 10 years ago he elected his son, Kevin, to be president of the ministry and Andrew is an anointed evangelist.

""So everything is ready and if the Lord wants to take me home in the next two months or two years, then I'm ready,"" the loving father maintained as his sons looked at him with heartbroken smiles.

Luis said he's going to continue living one day at a time and despite the sad prognosis he still feels good.

He shared the scripture that has been keeping him encouraged: Isaiah 41:10, which says, ""Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my victorious righteous right arm.""

""I know the Lord is with me, by the Holy Spirit indwelling, He is with us, we go through it, we go into the presence of the lord,"" Luis testified.

He also shared 2 Timothy 4 where the apostle Paul says, ""the time for my departure is here.""

The 83-year-old began to cry as he thought about leaving his family but he did say he still intends to complete the mission trips they have planned throughout the world for this year as God gives him the strength.

""Thank you for your prayers, thank you for loving us, thank you for your support,"" Luis said as he ended his portion.

Andrew concluded the video by saying that he's had many restless nights the past couple of days.

""I got up and read my Proverbs early and couldn't wait to come up and see your face,"" he told his dad.

He then quoted Proverbs 15, which says, ""The evidence of a happy heart is a cheerful face.""

""To think that you're facing what you're facing and day by day we see your happy face, it's proof that you're at peace,"" Andrew stated.

""We beg you to pray for dad and mom,"" he asked viewers.

Luis has been in ministry for more than 50 years. The Palau Association has collaborated with thousands of churches in hundreds of cities around the world in his life to this point. He's made an impact in top global cities: London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Chicago, Moscow, Madrid, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Washington, D.C., and more.

This reporter was in attendance in 2015 as he rallied 1,000 New York City churches together to make history in the Big Apple. It was one of the biggest evangelical moves in New York City as approximately 60,000 people gathered to hear the Gospel and worship. The Palau Association has coordinated hundreds of citywide campaigns just like it in dozens of nations, including major evangelistic festivals on all five continents.

55,9320,canadafreepress.com,conspiracy,http://canadafreepress.com/article/liberalitis-the-reckless-spending-and-despotic-disease-in-washington,"In less than one year, we are seeing our country go from a nation of laws to a nation of men. Obama, a community organizer, with his regime in Congress, is the one making the laws for all of us to obey, with or without constitutional authority to do so. Have the American voters gone completely insane?

Not the least of these laws include using the EPA to dictate and enforce draconian regulations in the name of the “global warming” hoax, whether Congress passes “Cap and Trade” or not. With the congressional “Clean Water Restoration Act,” the Obama regime intends to take over all water resources from coast to coast including the land these resources occupy and sustain. More on this in my next column. And now, the House of Pelosi has rammed through Barney Frank’s Financial Services Bill which gives the keys to the treasury to Lord Obama forever and gives ACORN a seat on the Financial Services Board.

I can’t decide if Obama is the biggest fool in history or the biggest liar in history. He seems to believe all of the ridiculous statements he uses in his speeches - or is it that he reads the teleprompter so well that he thinks we will believe he is sincere? He frequently uses conservative sounding phrases, and later follows them with contradictory socialist statements that marginalize or compromise what he previously said. He is a better double-talker than John Kerry was, but no more believable.

My reason for questioning his sincerity should be obvious to most people who read this. Obama consistently says one thing to the cameras while doing just the opposite. For example, he says he is trying to curb the recession and create jobs while his policies are doing just the opposite. The only jobs he is interested in creating are government jobs while he does nothing to encourage hiring in the private sector - which continues to lose jobs.

He says one of his highest priorities is to control spending and bring down the budget deficit and national debt. Then he and his congressional cabal go about their excessive spending and borrowing practices as though there were no tomorrow. The spending they have legislated is unsustainable and the debt they have run up is unrecoverable.

Is he so foolish to believe that the programs his advisors are giving him will really do what he says they will do, or is he deliberately lying to the American people to hide a sinister Marxist agenda? What we do know is that Obama is a Marxist as are his advisors. Their political philosophy and policies come straight out of Saul Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals” and Cloward-Piven, with pushes, shoves, and nudges by George Soros and Cass Sunstein.

The last time Americans were faced with this kind of oppressive government the Revolutionary War was the result, which led to the crafting of our Declaration of Independence (1776) and our Constitution in 1787. (My apologies for the stupid error in my last column dating the Constitution as 1776.) We may have to face this real crisis again, but won’t have to write new documents this time. We need only to enforce the ones we already have - the ones that the Obama regime is determined to ignore or overrule.

When our Founding Fathers declared their independence from the King of England, they claimed “taxation without representation.” Today we are being victimized and oppressed by the Obama regime for the same reason. Our money is being taken and nothing we want is being provided in return. On the contrary, they are using it for things we emphatically oppose, and strapping our citizens with unconscionable debt. They are grabbing every dollar and every ounce of credit they can to spend this country into insolvency.

Now they want to increase the national debt ceiling from 12.1 trillion to 14 trillion just to cover the entitlement programs already on the books until after the coming November 2010 elections, in spite of Obama‘s 2006 statement on the Senate floor: “Raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.” The current national debt is at 12.09 trillion, and at the current rate of spending, the 12.1 trillion ceiling will be reached in January.

Adding another trillion to the debt ceiling would last only until 3 months before the next election. That wouldn’t be good for Democrat re-election chances so if they increase it now by 1.9 trillion, they hope no one will notice or if they do, they won’t remember next November. This additional debt should last until the end of 2010, well after the elections.

The socialists have done nothing, absolutely nothing, to reduce the budget, the national debt, or their spending. Even the TARP loan payback money that banks have repaid to the government - which was supposed to go back into the treasury to help reduce the deficit - has been stolen by the Obama regime and diverted to his government job creation program. Or in other words, to his environmental and union supporters and other special interest lobbies.

Moody’s Investors Service says the U.S. and U.K. may loose their triple-A credit rating by 2013 “if economic growth lags, interest rates rise and the government fails to shrink the deficit or recover its loans to the financial sector.” Obama professes that he can solve the problem of government overspending with dramatic increases in government overspending. He prides himself on removing $100 million from a $1.2 billion wasteful spending bill. This is insane.

So in a year from now, when the debt reaches 14 trillion, what then? Just do it again? Where does it end? What is the end game? When will the goal of a Cloward-Piven financial collapse finally be realized? Will it happen before the next election?

How long will it be before this imitation president declares to the country that the government has no choice but to take over all private sector business and industry, and consequently redistribute the wealth, in order to “save the country” - or is it to “save the planet?” Closer to the truth would be to secure permanent political power for the socialist left. If you haven’t recognized it by now, that is the end game. We call it communism.

We now have two systems working against each other: a government socialist system competing against the private sector capitalist system. Who will hold these tyrants accountable to the Constitution and to the people? Only the voters can, if it’s not too late by next November and in 2012. Unfortunately, this regime has nearly a half trillion dollars of our money unspent from TARP and Stimulus to use as they wish to make sure that doesn’t happen.

Those who laid our constitutional foundation were very clear about its limits on government. Our Constitution’s principle author, James Madison, wrote, “The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined and will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation and foreign commerce.”

Concerning the legislature’s authority, Thomas Jefferson asserted: “Giving Congress a distinct and independent power to do any act they please which may be good for the Union, would render all the preceding and subsequent enumerations of power completely useless. It would reduce the whole Constitution to a single phrase, that of instituting a Congress with power to do whatever would be for the good of the United States; and as sole judges of the good or evil, it would be also a power to do whatever evil they please. Certainly, no such universal power was meant to be given them. The Constitution was intended to lace them up straightly within the enumerated powers and those without which, as means, these powers could not be carried into effect.”

Madison added, “If Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and will promote the General Welfare, the Government is no longer a limited one, possessing enumerated powers, but an indefinite one, subject to particular exceptions.”

If you quoted these verses to those in power today, they would think you were nuts. Madam Pelosi as much as said so when asked to state constitutional authority for her healthcare bill. Others in Congress had similar reactions and none could answer the question. The don’t believe in the Constitution or the limits it places on their powers.

This is not the government created by our Founding Fathers - this is not the government the American people want. The replacement constitution these people are creating is not the Constitution our Armed Forces are sworn to protect and defend. When did Hugo Chavez become president of the United States under the name of Barack Obama? Whose side will the military be on when push comes to shove? I think they well know who supports them and who doesn’t. And they know the Constitution they swore an oath to defend.

Americans, check your freedom at the door - it will not be returned to you. We must stop this madness now!",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Liberalitis: The Reckless Spending and Despotic Disease In Washington,"Jr Dieckmann, Because Without America, There Is No Free World.",,[''],,,

By Lisa Haven

We are inching towards World War III and I believe we are but moments away. In a recent turn of events Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has escalated his conflict with Turkish President Erdogan over the downing of the Russian bomber, by declaring Syria a no-fly zone for Turkish aircraft.

According to Putin, “Turkey used to violate Syrian airspace all the time. Let them try and fly there now.”

Gary Franchi’s Next News Network brings us more on this breaking report:

Furthermore, amid the Turkey and Russia tensions, Putin has been stepping up his rhetoric in what just might be a step towards war with the West. Putin also told a session of the Defense Ministry’s Collegium in which he stated that, “Any targets that threaten Russian forces or our infrastructure on the group should be immediately destroyed.”

Here is that breaking report brought to you by Gary Franchi’s the Next News Network…

Part 1 of a Message

Received by Mercedes Kirkel

On September 5, 2013

Hello everyone,

This is Mary Magdalene. Thank you to all of you who are listening and all of you who will be receiving this message in the future. I am so very happy to connect with all of you.

I wish to say a little bit about myself at this point. Some of you may already know this and some of you may be less familiar with what I’m about to share. I feel like it’s important to begin from this base of understanding about me and what I am bringing through at this time.

Many of you are familiar with me as a person who was recorded in the Bible as one of the followers of Jesus. My preferred way to refer to Jesus is through the name Yeshua, which is his Aramaic name. Aramaic was the language we were speaking at the time of his and my incarnation, two thousand years ago. So I will be referring to him as Yeshua, but this is the same one that many of you know as Jesus.

My relationship with Yeshua was a very sacred relationship. Everyone who was touched by him, who was involved with him in any way, had a sacred relationship with him. I had the great, great blessing and tremendous gift to be very close to him, in fact to be in sacred relationship with him. This is something I have explained in detail in the book Mary Magdalene Beckons: Join the River of Love. This is something that was not recorded in the Bible, for various reasons. The Bible was recorded long after our lifetimes. Those who decided what would and what would not be included in the Bible had their own decisions they were making and their own purposes. As part of that, it was decided that my story would largely not be included, except in very skeletal form.

But in fact, it is the case that I was Yeshua’s partner and we were in sacred relationship together. The reason for this is quite deep, quite complex. One aspect of it is that we both had work—very, very profound and important spiritual work—that we were bringing forth. It was understood that my part of this was to bring forth what I refer to as the Divine Feminine, or the Feminine face of God. I was incarnated with Yeshua as an example and a modeling of the union of Divine Masculine and Divine Feminine, in the form of a human man and woman.

But we also understood—Yeshua and myself, and others as well—that the world at that time was not ready for this aspect of our work and the teaching that we were bringing forth—the aspect of the Divine Feminine, the aspect of sacred relationship, the aspect of God having attributes or aspects that were both Masculine and Feminine. (Another way of saying this is Father-Mother-God.) At that time, two thousand years ago, the world was not prepared for this. We understood this. Even back when we were both physically incarnated, we knew that it would be two thousand years before the world was ready. That time has come. This is the time now. Not only is the world ready to receive the divine in Feminine form, and to receive my teaching of the Divine Feminine, but the world needs this. Receiving the Divine Feminine is very crucial to your time period right now.

There are many who are aware of this. I am not the first to say this and this occasion is certainly not the first time of this being stated. Many, many people who are aware, who are conscious, and many people who are tuned into higher beings are quite cognizant of this, that this is the time of the Divine Feminine coming through and coming forth, and that this is absolutely necessary right now.

This is one of the reasons why I have been coming through to Mercedes, as well as to other people. Part of my work is to be a leader in the transformation that humans are in the process of undergoing. This is a transformation from having the Divine Masculine as the predominant message you received and incarnated for a very long time. That message has predominated both in terms of your spirituality and also in terms of your more mundane world and aspects of that world—your politics, culture, education, and personal development. All of these have been quite dominated by the Masculine, what you could call the Divine Masculine. Now it is time for the Divine Feminine to come forth, to be incarnated, to be understood, and for all of you—men and women alike—to become strong in the Feminine, so that you can come into balance between the Masculine and the Feminine.

First and foremost, this must happen within yourselves. You all have your own inner Feminine and Masculine, which is a reflection or manifestation of the Divine Feminine and Divine Masculine. For all of you, this is where the work originates, within yourselves. For many of you, this will require strengthening the Feminine, because this has not been supported and developed for a very, very long time. Even those of you who feel great love of the Feminine and the Divine Feminine, who feel very positively oriented toward the Feminine, even you often have work within yourselves to do to strengthen your inner Feminine. This is very practical work. There are very practical arenas that need to be developed for this to become strong, because it has been withheld from you, in so many ways, for so very long.

As I talked about in the messages that are recorded in the book Mary Magdalene Beckons, there are three primary arenas where the Feminine needs to be strong. It is within these three arenas that many people need to examine themselves and see what work they may have to do to complete the strengthening of the Feminine within. This is so important for people to do at this time. First and foremost, this is work for you to do with yourself, for your own strengthening and balancing. Secondly, this work needs to be done for your sacred relationships you will be engaging in your life, that these can come into balance. The third very important reason is that you are not only doing this work for yourself. You do this as service to humanity, for your whole world. As you transform, as you strengthen and develop and grow yourself, you are affecting what is accessible for people, what is available to people, and what is becoming strong for your whole world. Any time you do growth and transformation work for yourself, it affects everyone. That is very, very important at this time.

You are all at a very critical juncture, where there is great opportunity opening up for your world, and for human beings, in particular, to transition into a higher level of consciousness. This will be reflected in a higher dimension of reality coming in and being the realm that you all inhabit, that you know, that you live in and are manifesting in. This is the great opportunity you have at this time. Those of you who are on your spiritual path, who are light-workers, very likely those of you who are listening to me at this time, many of you are quite aware of this. I, and so many beings of the higher realms, thank you for all that you are doing to support this amazing transformation that is underway in your world. This is not only affecting the Earth. This transformation is so vast and involves so many places in your universe, all of which you are affecting through the spiritual work you are doing. It is most important. We thank all of you for this.

I am aware that I have wandered away a bit from where I started, which was explaining about the Divine Feminine and the arenas through which this manifests within each of you. Now I wish to return to that. What I want to explain is that there are these three arenas that are the foundation of the Divine Feminine within each one of you: the relationship with your physical body, the relationship with your sexuality, and the relationship with your emotions. For each of you, these are the places that I strongly urge you to examine and see what may need strengthening within yourself. This is what I talked about in great depth in the messages I gave in the book Mary Magdalene Beckons, along with my guidance and instruction as to what each of you can do to strengthen these areas. As I said at that time, of these three, the area that is most critical for the most people is the way that you respond to pain.

The area of emotions, for many people, is quite confusing. Your emotions are truly a gift from the divine that is rather unique to human beings in your realm. Yet many of you do not yet fully understand how to receive this gift that has been given to you in the emotional realm and how to work with emotions, particularly your painful emotions. This is the part that is most challenging for many of you. You did not receive help and support and guidance in understanding the pathway of how to respond to painful emotions, how to receive the gift from God that’s being given to you through these emotions, and how to make use of emotions to support your spiritual journey, to support your uniting with God.

Because you did not receive that instruction and that guidance, and because you do not fully understand it, I especially focused on that in my earlier messages that are recorded in Mary Magdalene Beckons. I gave detailed instruction about how you can respond differently to your painful emotions in a way that will be most supportive of you, most supportive of your spiritual connection, and most supportive of your forward movement in your spiritual evolution. I did this because, from my vantage point, this is the area that is holding most people back from their spiritual growth in general, and specifically from the incarnation of the Divine Feminine.

This is why I said earlier that while many of you are so positively oriented to the Divine Feminine and the Feminine in all her forms (which is a most wonderful thing), even so, for many of you there may still be work to do in these three arenas, and especially in the emotional arena in terms of how you respond to pain. I urge you to make use of the instruction I have given and to learn these pathways of incarnating the Divine Feminine, which will support you and help to transform you, and in that process, transform your world.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

I give credit to the scientists for having a bit of ironic humor in an article recently published about one of the foods I do avoid. I could never recall if it was the months with or without an “r” that you were supposed to avoid eating raw oysters. Now, I guess it really does not matter if the water they were grown in contain human feces.

BC oysters and norovirus: Hundreds of cases in months with an “r”

British Columbia Medical Journal, Vol. 59, No. 6, July, August 2017, page(s) 326,327 BC Centre for Disease Control

Lorraine McIntyre, MSc, Eleni Galanis, MD, MPH, FRCPC, Natalie Prystajecky, PhD, Tom Kosatsky, MD

Between November 2016 and March 2017 more than 400 individuals across Canada developed norovirus gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of BC oysters. Over 100 cases occurred mid-November in participants at a Tofino oyster festival. Six cases occurred in persons attending a December oyster barbecue in Victoria. By March over 300 additional cases of norovirus linked to cultivated BC oysters harvested from multiple sites on both the east and west coasts of Vancouver Island were identified in BC, Alberta, and Ontario consumers.

Norovirus is a highly infectious cause of gastroenteritis typically spread from person to person and is associated with regular community outbreaks in schools, hospitals, day cares, and care facilities. Foodborne outbreaks of norovirus are often linked to ill food handlers. In this recent outbreak, oysters were contaminated in the marine environment where they were farmed. The trace-back of oysters consumed by infected individuals led to the closure of 13 geographically dispersed marine farms in BC (see map) and to extensive public outreach.

Genotypic analysis of norovirus isolated from the cases included several variants of genogroup I (GI) early in the outbreak and both genogroups GI and GII later in the outbreak.

Both GI and GII norovirus were detected in oysters from shellfish farms. This suggests that oysters bind and act as a reservoir for community outbreak strains and disseminate those strains to consumers.[1]

Although sewage is often the cause of oyster contamination it remains unclear whether one or many sewage sources contributed to the contamination of shellfish farms. The 2016–17 outbreak was preceded by a wet fall and accompanied an unseasonably cold winter. Wet, cold, and dark winters enhance norovirus survival, allowing for longer retention in ocean sediments and in oysters.[2,3] The infective dose of norovirus is estimated as few as 18 particles.[2] Given the low infective dose and the viability of norovirus in cold water, we postulate that sewage spread by ocean currents may have contaminated geographically dispersed farms. Among potential sources under investigation are sewer overflows, metropolitan and local wastewater treatment plants, municipal raw sewage discharge, and commercial fishing vessels. The BCCDC is leading a collaborative group reviewing pollution sources discharging to BC marine environments that may have contaminated BC oysters.

In this outbreak, both raw and cooked oysters led to illness; oysters were likely insufficiently cooked to inactivate norovirus. In addition to norovirus, pathogens like Vibrio sp., Salmonella sp., and hepatitis A can be transmitted to oyster consumers; cooking oysters to an internal temperature of 90 °C for at least 90 seconds will reduce this risk. The “rule” that shellfish is safe to eat in months with an “r” (September to April) is false. First, bacteria and viruses persist in cold seawater. Second, marine biotoxins (saxitoxin and domoic acid that cause paralytic and amnesic shellfish poisoning) occur year round.

Physicians and laboratories play an important role in controlling foodborne disease. In this outbreak, trace-back of oysters linked to cases was used to close shellfish farms. If you see patients with acute gastroenteritis who recently consumed shellfish, inform your local public health office and submit stool samples for testing.[4]

The authors acknowledge partners in the national outbreak investigation and the environmental transmission of norovirus working group.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

The post below was written by Joseph Tye, of TX CopBlock, and posted at various other alternative media outlets. These are great tips for anyone but most certainly for a CopBlocker. Tye may do additional features, that are more detailed, in the future so if you have questions, concerns or suggestions please comment below.

The first thing I notice about many activists and protesters is their total lack of digital security. Most of us carry around a computer in our pocket that allows us to do amazing things, from recording high definition videos and taking photos to accessing the most amazing collection of data the human race has ever amassed. Yet despite the capabilities of this amazing device, few actually understand what this device is capable of. This will be a basic guide written for the average user, and as such it will gloss over many things, and drastically over-simplify the technical aspects of many others for the sake of simplicity.

Every time that you use a computer of any kind, certain security precautions must be taken in order to ensure your personal safety from both those who would steal your data and the State which may wish to either claim that you have violated one or more of their illegitimate rules, or else simply frame you for such. Basic security measures are inexpensive, often free, and easy enough for even those less technical users.

The first recommendation is always to fully encrypt your device. As the recent FBI vs. Apple court case showed, even this simple step is enough to put a thorn in the side of a huge State agency with practically limitless resources. Encryption is a way to make the data useless without the correct passphrase. While recent iPhones (anything after the iPhone 3GS) are encrypted by default, Android devices are not.

However, this is a very simple process, and step-by-step guides for every device available are easily accessed through a simple online search. Most devices running a recent version of the Android Operating System can be encrypted by going to Settings > More (tab) > Security. Make sure your phone is fully charged before attempting this, as it may take a while. If given the option, always choose to fully encrypt any external memory you have in your phone.

Many people love the option of using a fingerprint to decrypt their phone and consider it to be highly secure, however, please take into account the courts have ruled that you have a right against self-incrimination that is enumerated under the fifth amendment against giving up your passphrase in order to decrypt your phone, while you have no right against giving up your finger print. If arrested for any activism, it is highly likely that your mobile device will be seized, and unless you wish the actors of the State to have access to everything on it, (think of photos and videos of persons committing civil disobedience, personal photos or data, access to your social media, etc.) then this is something you may wish to take into account. Also, it is impossible for State agents to plant “suicide notes,” or evidence on something they cannot access. Just having a passcode on your phone does not mean it cannot be accessed, it must be encrypted!

Further security precautions would include turning off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth when you are not actively using them. These features provide others with a way to access your phone that you do not want.The second recommendation is for a good antivirus program. You may call this a cell phone, but it is not. It is a mobile computer with phone capabilities. If you cannot afford a paid program, then there are some that are available for free, of which I recommend BitDefender. However, I personally only use Kaspersky Internet Security for my Android. I have found it to be among the best available with a feature set that is particularly useful for those involved in activism, including the ability to remotely lock the phone, and even remotely wipe the phone of data. Here I must make a legal disclaimer, in all jurisdictions I am aware of, it is illegal to tamper with evidence, and wiping data from a phone could be taken as such if the State agents wish to make a case against you, so use such features at your own discretion. Personally, I like having this option available. Remember that not all people who would seek to exploit your information are employees of the State.

For those who wish to use the internet anonymously from their mobile device and prevent others from being able to electronically gather their passphrases used over the internet when browsing over an unsecure Wi-Fi hotspot then a Virtual Private Network(VPN) is a must have. Paid VPN services are cheap, fast, and easy to use. Arguably the best available is “Private Internet Access.” It can be bought anonymously over the internet and downloaded to a total of five devices. This service provides a secure connection from your device, be it a mobile device or home personal computer to one of over thirty of their servers world-wide. Your data cannot be read until it reaches their end server and is decrypted there. This not only prevents people from being able to intercept your data over Wi-Fi but can also be used to mask your true location. The encryption protocols offered by the company Private Internet Access are the best available, and considered as of yet to be unbreakable. The free options available are much more difficult for a beginner, and tend to have far more restricted bandwidth (they are “slow”).

196,30562,americanlookout.com,bias,http://americanlookout.com/media-critic-the-press-is-falling-into-the-presidents-trap/,"Howard Kurtz is the media critic for FOX News. He is fair in his assessment of the media which has gone over the edge in its coverage of Trump.

The Hollywood reporter has excerpted part of Kurtz’s new book on the subject:

How “Trump Trauma” Is Crippling the News Media (Guest Column)

On Jan. 8, 2017, days before Donald Trump was to assume the crushing burdens of the presidency, he faced a very different kind of problem: Meryl Streep.

The iconic actress slammed him in her speech accepting the Cecil B. DeMille lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes, attacking him for, among other things, having allegedly mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during the campaign. The next morning, Hope Hicks, the president’s loyal young assistant who was almost always by Trump’s side, pulled out her phone to play footage of Kellyanne Conway on the CNN and Fox morning shows.

Kellyanne said that charge had been repeatedly refuted and added that if Streep were so concerned about the rights of the disabled, she should have spoken out about a disabled boy who had been badly beaten by young thugs shouting anti-Trump epithets in a video that had been posted on Facebook. Trump loved that answer and started venting about his media coverage.

Hicks retreated to a nearby desk, where she spoke to Times reporter Patrick Healy. He had called Trump’s cellphone during the Globes and then quoted the president-elect as saying he wasn’t surprised by criticisms from “liberal movie people.” Hicks took Healy to task.

The worst part about the media is that they aren’t even trying to hide their bias anymore.",2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Media Critic: “The Press Is Falling Into The President’s Trap”,Mike Lachance,,[''],,"News, Donald Trump, Media, Media Bias, Politics",

It’s Not Really President Trump Who Needs His Mouth Washed Out With Soap



Throwing the spotlight on so-called Men of the Cloth: It’s not President Donald Trump who needs to have his mouth washed out with soap for having allegedly made use of the vulgar ‘s’ word at a White House meeting on immigration. There’s just no getting around it that some words are more painful than cuss words, particularly when they heap praise on abortion advocates. “Members of President Trump’s evangelical advisory council decided to jump ship for the day and publicly sided with Nancy Pelosi on DACA. (RedState, Jan. 18, 2018)

“You have always taken the lead. Your commitment to the immigrant community to the ‘Dreamers’ is second to none. So America is in a better place because of your prophetic leadership on this matter,” the Rev.Samuel Rodriguez, who spoke at Trump’s inauguration last year, told Pelosi at a press conference on Thursday.” Prophetic? Really?” Pelosi, of course, is one of the loudest advocates of abortion ever elected, coming second only to former President Barack Obama, champion of partial birth abortion. How sincere was Rev. Rodriguez when he raised the name of President Donald Trump in prayer at his inauguration? Discomfited by the president’s use of an expression he has denied using, Rev. Rodriguez, a member of the “unofficial” evangelical advisory board and the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference noted that “every single person is created in the image of God” and spoke of welcoming people equally from Nigeria and Norway, albeit after “a rigorous vetting process.” “Later in the day, he said more: “In addition, and with great due deference, I believe that the comments attributed to our president can best be described as wrong, inappropriate, and hurtful. Why? Because when God looks at these nations, He sees His children.” (Yahoo, Jan. 15, 2018)

It should go without saying that our Creator sees among “His children, millions of babies killed in their mother’s wombs. Sadly, the pastor is not the only one who hypocritically regards the president’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word as more preach-worthy than the open advocation of abortion. Isn’t it more than a tad hypocritical, if not downright sanctimonious that the Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano would try a wash-his-mouth-with-soap stance on the latest alleged expletive of President Donald Trump? We all know by now that President Trump’s alleged use of the ‘s’ word was tattle-taled to the Internet world by Catholic U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, who went straight to the media to report the vulgarity had been “repeatedly” used at a White House meeting on immigration. Tattletale Dicky Durbin

Continued below... The newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano—the Vatican’s flagship—gave Trump’s comments about the immigration debate in the United States, front page attention, noting the comments had immediately sparked “controversy and indignation”. Never mind that Trump denies using the term. Mercifully, the newspaper did not print the vulgar word that automatically spiralled the Democrats into a full-on faux rage. No, none of that over here. But it’s not just vulgar expletives that rile people up. Some words indiscriminately used to honor abortion advocates are just as—if not more—offensive to the Faithful. Some some pro-life Catholics must have thought of the ‘s’ word when reading on Twitter that abortion advocate Lilianne Ploumen, former Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation in the Netherlands, was recently honored by Pope Francis with the title of ‘Commander in the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great’. This was one Tweet that turned out to be as troubling as it was true: “The Lepanto Institute was able to confirm from a December 22, 2017 Dutch radio broadcast that Ploumen indeed received the honor. In a brief video clip promoting the broadcast, Ploumen displays the medal while saying that she received it from the Pope. (Lepanto Institute, Jan.12, 2018)

“To say that Lilianne Ploumen is “pro-abortion” is an extreme understatement and doesn’t even come close to the scandalous reality of her activism. “In January of last year, after US President Donald Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, Ploumen launched a new NGO called She Decides to provide mass amounts of funds to organizations that would no longer receive funds from the US government. The Mexico City Policy automatically denies US funding for international organizations which perform or promote abortion. “Referring to the Mexico City Policy as a “Global Gag Rule,” Ploumen stated that the intention of She Decides was to continue support for existing programs being run by organizations such as the United Nations Population Fund (UNPFA), the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International. She said, “These are successful and effective programs: direct support, distributing condoms, making sure women are accompanied at the birth, and making sure abortion is safe if they have no other choice.” The LePanto Institute continues their Ploumen profile: “But Ploumen’s anti-Catholic activity isn’t restricted to abortion. In September of 2017, Ploumen participated in the United Nations LGBTI Core Group. As the first speaker at the event, Ploumen noted that “LGBTI rights are human rights.” In her opening remarks, she said, “We cannot be complacent. [Today] in more than 70 countries homosexuality is still criminalized…stigma against LGBT people continue all over the world.” “In 2014, Ploumen ended foreign aid to the country of Uganda for passing a bill banning sodomy and same-sex “marriage.” In February of 2010, Ploumen called on LGBT activists to descend upon and disrupt Mass at St. John the Baptist Cathedral, wearing pink triangles with the words “Jesus excludes no one.” “The reason? She and other pro-LGBT activists were protesting the Church’s moral teaching regarding homosexuality.”

Continued below... We already know how Pope Francis profiles President Donald Trump: “In 2016, in response to a question about then-candidate Trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, Francis said a man with such views was “not Christian”. (Reuters, Jan. 12, 2018) “Trump, who grew up in a Presbyterian family, shot back saying it was “disgraceful” for the pope to question his faith.” Actions speak so much louder than cuss words. Thousands will be taking part in the 2018 March for Life today. Neither Rev. Rodriguez nor Pope Francis will be there, but President Trump will be, addressing the crowd by satellite.

60,10417,washingtonexaminer.com,political,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/flyover-country-farmers-and-dc-bureaucrats-push-philadelphia-refinery-into-bankruptcy/article/2646687,"A crowd enveloped a bus. Daredevils scaled greased light poles. Someone started lighting fireworks. That was the scene outside Lincoln Financial Field as boisterous Eagles fans celebrated their 38-7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. The celebration was much-needed, because Philadelphia was losing elsewhere.

Thirty minutes into that game, and three miles away from the stadium, workers at the oil refinery owned by Philadelphia Energy Solutions had been informed that their jobs were in jeopardy.

Reuters reported Sunday that the company will soon file for bankruptcy, that its 1,100 employees might need to start looking for a new line of work. Those jobs were secure for years — the refinery was the largest oil refining complex on the East Coast.

Where can the soon-to-be unemployed direct their anger? Farmers in flyover country and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.

The refinery is going broke, Reuters reports, largely because of the government. Since 2012, Philadelphia Energy Solutions has spent $800 million to comply with the Renewable Fuels Standard, which forces refiners to blend a certain amount of biofuels into the fuel supply or to purchase credits.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

I am a mother of four in my mid 30\’s and I have been told that I have some psychic abilities, mainly psychometry, paranormal, and lately remote viewing. Things come to me in the form of pictures in my mind, feelings and impressions, and sometimes sounds. I typically get them when asked to focus on specific objects or events. I clear my mind, think of the question or object and this blog is an example of what I get. This blog is a way for me to organize all my thoughts. 8:47 PM Today I wanted to do a short response to some questions I recevied on the Zimmerman case. So here they are….

Q. With regards to the Trayvon Martin case. Did it really happened the way Zimmerman said it did. Did Trayvon threw the first punch?

A. I definitely see that Trayvon was uncomfortable… I also get a suspicious vibe. Like Martin didn’t do anything yet, but it was because he felt he was being watched. I’m getting an image of someone working security (undercover security at a department store and watching someone (being Martin) to make sure they don’t steal something. The person watched, doesn’t realize it at first, but they are “lurking around” and not just going from point A to point B. I just see this lingering….

Then there comes a point where Martin realizes that he is being watched… At that point he gets angry. More that his “lingering” got interrupted more than the straight up fact that he was being watched. I see that he (referring to Martin) felt like Zimmerman was a rude interruption to something… exactly like he was rudely interrupted.

Martin got really defensive, and I see him as the first to yell. It was in an irate way. Zimmerman didn’t back down and stood there confidently I see Martin had the chance to leave then, very early on, and he didn’t take it because he was so angry. At this point I start to hear a lot of foul language.. The F word is being used both ways and i hear the phrase “pissed” and “pissed off” with that focusing more on Martin.

Now I see Martin doing some kind of a boxers tip-toe dance and bouncing around. It was like Martin knew there was going to be a fight, and he wanted a chance to have the first punch. Martin wasn’t scared, he was so full of adrenaline My heart is beating hard. Martin was focused.. It does appear that Martin did throw the first punch.

Q. Was the screaming Trayvon’s?

A. As I focus on that I hear Martin’s side yelling, but not making words. Just sounds as they are fighting. More like a growl. It was as if when he exhaled it was a “sound” rather than a breath.

I do see Zimmerman yelling… which leads to the next question that was asked…

Q. Zimmerman’s account does not add up. If he had a gun, why would he be screaming for help?

A. I see he had a gun, but didn’t want to use it. He was screaming trying to get people to help so Martin could be restrained and taken in. I don’t see that he sought out to shoot him. He wanted Martin to realize that he was being watched so if he didn’t intend to do some kind of crime (or tell he friends about a possible crime) that his appearance had been known. I keep flashing back to Wisteria Lane on Desperate Housewives and feel the neighborhood had a closeness about it as Wisteria Lane did, so to yell for help feels right and normal.. I see that Zimmerman carried a gun like an insurance policy, never really thinking he would ever need to use it. Even as he grabbed he was kind of awkward. Like he didn’t make a fluid motion for it.

And those are the questions I have received so far. It is 9:11 PM Link to Audio

The US Dollar extended this week’s rally from 3-month lows on the currency market, pushing the Euro down to $1.19205, a 7-session low.

That held the price of wholesale gold investment bars above €1100 per ounce for French, German and Italian investors, its strongest level for nearly 9 weeks.

China’s Yuan also fell against the Dollar, while Shanghai gold premiums – an indicator of demand and supply inside the world’s No.1 mining, importing and consumer nation – slipped back to $7 per ounce above London quotes.

With only 5 weeks until China’s peak Lunar New Year shopping season, that was near the weakest incentive for new bullion imports since mid-September.

“Gold could finally break out of its four-year trading range if inflation starts to lift globally,” says a new 2018 commodities outlook from former London bullion clearing bank Barclays, tipping mining stocks more broadly as “compelling [on] a strengthening macro backdrop , limited capex, strong earnings momentum…cheap valuation multiples and light [investor] positioning.”

Shorter term, “Gold should see [support] at the recent low of $1315 and the psychological $1300 level below that,” reckons Swiss refining and finance group MKS Pamp’s Asian trading desk.

“On the upside, a break above lasts weeks high of $1324 could see the yellow metal make a move on the September top of $1355.”

The September peak “will be a decisive level for a larger up trend” agrees French investment and bullion market-making bank Societe Generale’s technical analysis team today, calling that $1350-1356 level “the neckline” of a “large Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern.”

This major reversal pattern “forms after a downtrend,” explains StockCharts. “[It] contains three successive troughs with the middle trough (head) being the deepest and the two outside troughs (shoulders) being shallower.

“A clear move above $1356 will mean confirmation of the formation,” says SocGen’s note, “and this will lead to next leg of up move towards $1433/1485 first.”

“It is quite possible that the yellow metal could attempt to hit $1357 in the not too distant future,” says a separate note from Canadian brokerage TD Securities, “[because] investors seem ready to take hefty long gold positions even as equity markets are surging.”

Last week’s positioning data for Comex gold futures and options showed the sharpest jump in speculative bullish betting by money managers, net of that group’s bearish bets, since mid-August.

TD’s Bart Melek gave the best 2017 average gold price forecast in industry body the LBMA’s annual competition last year, predicting $1257 per ounce against the $1256 out-turn at London’s afternoon benchmarking.

He now forecasts a 4.5% rise in gold for 2018, predicting an average annual price of $1313 per ounce.

Near term, “A move toward $1375 is possible should the market believe the US central bank will be gentle in their rate hike signaling,” says TD’s latest note.",2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Gold Price Slips But Technical Analysts Target Break Above $1355 Sept High,,,[''],,,

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Back in August of 2014 there was a big buzz around the sale of BTC.com for $1million. Domain Guardians brokered the sale and Mike Robertson gave an interview to TheDomains.com on how the sale went down.

Today the buyer Josh Garza has been charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

CoinDesk reported:

The US Securities and Exchange Commission has charged former GAW Miners CEO Josh Garza with the fraudulent sale of unlicensed securities and the operation of a Ponzi scheme. The complaint, filed today in the US District Court for the District of Connecticut, focuses largely on the sale of Hashlets, the “virtual miners” sold by GAW Miners through its cloud mining site, ZenCloud. The SEC said that Garza and GAW earned roughly $19 million in revenue from the scheme, which evolved from hardware hosting to cloud mining to the eventual launch of an alternative cryptocurrency and has as many as 10,000 customers and investors. According to the SEC, Garza and GAW Miners knowingly misrepresented the nature of Hashlets, their proclaimed profitability and the manner in which mining income was sourced.

The domain was registered in 1997 has been under privacy at Go Daddy for years. The site is developed but the about us talks about Bitmain Technologies LTD.

Tech Crunch did an interview with Garza on the purchase of BTC.com last year.

176,27272,naturalnews.com,junksci,https://www.naturalnews.com/055405_opioids_Big_Pharma_addiction_epidemic.html,"(NaturalNews) If you thought Big Pharma couldn't sink any lower, you were wrong. A recent report led by theand the Center for Public Integrity, has revealed that the manufacturers of opioid drugs, such as OxyContin, Vicodin and fentanyl, spent a whopping $880 million on campaign contributions and lobbying efforts. This huge amount of money was spent pushing against state efforts to restrict the amount of prescription opioid drugs floating around.For the unaware, the United States is currently experiencing an opioid epidemic – one that has been particularly profitable for Big Pharma. OxyContin has been one of the most prolific drugs in the prescription opioid craze, and one of the most addictive.writes that a recent expose by theuncovered the fact that Purdue Pharma knowingly lied about their product. Despite being marketed as a 12-hour pill, the' handiwork revealed that Purdue ""knew the claim was a lie, as did its sales reps, patients, medical professional and even regulatory authorities. At best, Oxy only provided eight hours of pain relief ...""This means that patients were exposed to withdrawal symptoms, received inadequate care, and were often pushed up to a higher dose of OxyContin – which puts patients at increased risk of death. However, higher dosages make more money than more frequent doses, so this was a very clever, and malevolent , marketing choice by Purdue.You can see where this is the kind of company that caresabout public well-being, and quite a lot about profits. It is not surprising that Purdue Pharma, and others like them, have spent nearly a billion dollars trying to protect their hold on the American people. Between 2006 and 2015, Big Pharma spent nearly 200 times more fighting opioid restrictions than opioid restriction advocates spent in the same time period. Sadly, it is not just Big Pharma pushing their agenda. Even organizations that many people consider to be ""respectable,"" have dipped their toes in the pond. The American Cancer Society, for example, has reportedly teamed up with the pharmaceutical industry.Opioids are very similar to heroin, only they can be prescribed to patients as pain relievers. Due to their highly addictive nature, it is no surprise that the industry desperately wants to protect their ability to be prescribed to anyone for just about anything; opioids are a cash cow.Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a tremendous supporter of prescription opioid reform, told the: ""They are reaping enormous profits from aggressive prescribing."" And while they benefit, millions suffer.Over 2 million Americans reportedly suffer with an addiction to opioid drugs. Just shy of a half-million people suffer with heroin addiction, as well. The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that roughly 80 percent of all heroin users report that their addiction began with misusing opioid drugs . Being that prescription opioids are rather expensive, it is no surprise that people eventually move on to less expensive options. This figure shows that it is not just people currently using prescription opioids that are being harmed by these drugs, but many others as well. One could even postulate that a significant portion of heroin overdoses could be traced back to opioids, in addition to the thousands of deaths caused by opioids directly. Some estimates indicate that opioids are related to up to 60 deaths each day Spending $880 million on protecting their profits instead of supporting legislation that would help to end the opioid epidemic ensured that their priorities would be easily understood. Despite the claims of Big Pharma companies like Purdue that they actually care about addiction and the people affected by it, it has becomeclear that thethey care about is the fact that it makes them money.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Big Pharma spent $880 million fighting against state opioid restrictions,"Friday, September, Vicki Batts",,"['opioids', 'Big Pharma', 'addiction epidemic', 'Big Pharma', 'drug', 'opioids', 'NaturalNews', 'prescription']",Big Pharma spent $880 million fighting against state opioid restrictions,,

I am tired of being told I am the bad guy and America is the problem

Illegal Means Illegal: Close the Border

Notice the emphasis on one word used twice in the title of this commentary: ILLEGAL. There is a current real problem and threat to America’s financial well-being and cultural stability. This invasion from Mexico has reached epidemic proportions and no one in power seems to even notice there is a problem.

Don’t be fooled by all the media hype. Border crashers are ILLEGAL and they are ALIENS to this country. A few years back, political correctness tried to tone down the harshness and began calling them illegal immigrants. Now they even resent this label. Well, either they are illegal or they are not. The next step is to call them unauthorized immigrants which eventually will be followed by the title unauthorized Americans or Americans without citizenship. They are already referred to as undocumented workers. I for one am sick and tired of Mexico sending troops in to take over. Notice, I did not say I was sick of Mexicans. I am tired of the ILLEGAL (there’s that word again) ones. I am tired of them breaking the law and bypassing the legal steps to become citizens. I am tired of them demanding amnesty or immediate citizenship, as if it is their right by virtue of their presence in this country. It is a slap in the face to those who obey the law and earn legitimate citizenship. People who become Americans are supposed to learn the language, pass tests, and have a knowledge of our history and political system so they can appreciate and respect this country and be assimilated into American culture. In years past, during the time of real immigration at Ellis Island, America was known as the melting pot. If immigrants do not melt into the pot, then the pot ceases to be one pot of unity, creating many pots of individual cultures of division. America has ceased to be unique and is losing her identity.

I am tired of real, genuine, bona fide Americans being called racist when they speak the truth on this issue. More and more ILLEGALS are attending the Jackson/Sharpton race card playing school and learning the lingo. I wish they would spend as much time learning English…....and abiding by the law. I am tired of the law not being enforced. Call me crazy, but shouldn’t illegals be arrested and deported? I am tired of Republicans and Democrats selling us down the river as they flip and flop around with spines of jelly. It has always amazed me how most politicians can stand erect on two legs without falling. It takes a spine, so how do they even walk upright? I’m tired of the accusation of not acting like a Christian about the situation. Being Christian means following the law. Why is it Christians are always supposed to do the right thing, but lawbreakers are exempt? I am tired of being told by computers, when making a phone call, to press “one” to continue in English. EVERYTHING should automatically be in English, with an option to press “one” if Spanish is needed. I am tired of illegals having access to government services funded by Americans. Basically, I am tired of being told I am the bad guy and America is the problem. As I read somewhere recently, America is a private country with borders and laws, not a public park with open access.
